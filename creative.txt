Creative Portion:
For our Creative Portion:
1) we used bootstrap to make the site look nice
2) we used socket connection/disconnection in order to update the current room information when a user leaves the page, not just when the users goes back to the lobby
3) we added a snapshot of user infromation related to how many messages they sent (including general lobby messages, room messages, and private messages), as well as private messages they've received.
